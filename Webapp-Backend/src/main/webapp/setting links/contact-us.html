    <h3>1. Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
        Our mission is to build a smart home platform that enhances sustainability, security, 
        and convenience. We aim to help homeowners reduce energy and water consumption while 
        providing seamless control over daily household tasks through intuitive digital tools.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
        We are a team of students at the American University of Sharjah developing the 
        <strong>Sustainable Smart House</strong> system as part of our coursework. Our expertise covers 
        frontend design, backend development, database management, and interactive 
        smart-home feature implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. What We Built</h3>
    <p>
        Our system includes secure login functionality, dashboards for monitoring 
        energy and water consumption, and tools to control home devices such as AC, lights, 
        thermostats, sprinklers, and more. Users can schedule tasks, check efficiency levels, 
        and manage device groups across different rooms and floors.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Technology We Use</h3>
    <p>
        This platform is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Java (Jakarta Servlets), 
        and SQL. These technologies allow us to build a responsive, secure, and high-performance 
        smart home environment that is both scalable and user-friendly.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Development Team</h3>
    <p>
        This project was created by:
        <br>- Saeed Ibrahim Moselhy (b00101949)
        <br>- Saif Almas (b00100949)
        <br>- Abdulrahman Mohammed (b00101384)
        <br>- Baraa Saifi (b00097897)
        <br><br>
        Each member contributed to different aspects of the project, including UI design, 
        backend logic, device/sensor modeling, database structure, and system integration.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Our Values</h3>
    <p>
        We prioritize sustainability, system transparency, data privacy, and reliable automation. 
        We believe that intelligent technology should not only make life more convenient but also 
        promote environmentally responsible behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Project Goals</h3>
    <p>
        The Sustainable Smart House demonstrates full-stack development skills, covering:
        user authentication, device control logic, smart scheduling, data visualization, 
        database modeling, and real-time monitoring of home efficiency. Our goal is to show 
        how modern software can make homes smarter and greener.
    </p>
