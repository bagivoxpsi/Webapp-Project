                    <p>
                        We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create an account, 
                        update your profile, or contact us for support. This may include your name, email address,

                        to communicate with you, and to personalize your experience. We may also use your

                        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information 
                        to outside parties except as described in this policy. This does not include trusted
